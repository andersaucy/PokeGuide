# Andersaucy's WebScraper
Web scraping practice. </br>
Many jobs will involve Pokemon data, which I've derived from sources such as Smogon and Veekun

## Project Files
### SmogonToDex.py
Runs a BeautifulSoup script to store all generations of Pokemon from <a href ="https://www.smogon.com/dex/"> Smogon's Dex</a> in plain text CSV files.

### VeekunToXlsx.py
Runs a Selenium script to save images of Types and Pokemon Sprites from <a href = "https://veekun.com/dex/pokemon">Veekun Dex</a> into Xlsx filetypes.
